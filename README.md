I'll help you run a Docker image with the tag "web_chat" on port 8501.

To run a Docker image, you need to use the `docker run` command with port mapping. Here's the command you should use:

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 web_chat
```

This command:
- Uses `docker run` to start a container
- Maps port 8501 on your host to port 8501 in the container with `-p 8501:8501`
- Uses the image tagged as `web_chat`

If you need to run the container in detached mode (in the background), add the `-d` flag:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8501:8501 web_chat
```
